## Lore
A long time ago, the 4 elemental kingdoms lived in harmony, peace and prosperity in the world of Asturi. These kingdoms possess the power of the Elements namely Fire, Water, Wind and Earth. ~~But then, the fire nation attacked~~. 

The 4 elements was possessed by the 4 elemental kings, they have the power to bend the element to their will. 

Until one day, a great meteor was seen visible in the skies. The four kingdoms erupts in panic and many wizards  prophesied it as the end of the world. It was told that the great meteor is the element of corruption that seeks to bring chaos and destruction to the world of Asturi.

The four kingdoms forged an alliance to stop the great meteor from destroying their world and the 4 elemental kings united as one hoping to defeat the great meteor. 

Cycle 420BGM (before the great meteor), as the great meteor draws to a close to the world of Asturi, the 4 elemental kings combined and channeled their elements to form a giant beam to stop the great meteor.

 Even with the combined powers of the 4 elemental kings, the meteor still wrecks havoc to the world of Asturi. 

The four elemental kings are dead, their powers scattered throughout the world, the meteor ravaged civilisations by the billions, and has put the world back to the dark ages. 

Without the elemental kings controlling the force of the elements, the world continues to be ravaged by destruction and chaos, and the element of corruption ruled the world.

This results in spawning different kind of monsters, battling other monsters different from their elements. this 1000 cycles of fighting and chaos is called the "The Endless Elemental Wars" era.

This is where you come in. You got the mark of the 4 elements, as the wise wizards would put it, you are the chosen one, the restorer of peace, the last prophet, the purifier of corruption, the one true king. ~~The avatar~~. Your quest is to restore the balance of the 4 elements and defeat the element of corruption.
